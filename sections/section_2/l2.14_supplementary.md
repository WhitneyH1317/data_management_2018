**NOTE:** *This section (supplementary code) is meant to provide advanced examples of how database tools can be used to improve the management of tracking data. The code itself is introduced to illustrate the goals and functionalities but the technical details are not explained because they require an advanced knowledge of database programming. The idea is that this supplementary code can be used as it is or as a study example for they who want to explore and learn advances features offered by spatial database.*

### <a name="c_2.14.1"></a>Timestamping changes in the database using triggers

It can often be useful to know not only when a record is created but also the last time that a record has been modified and who modified it. This is important to keep track of what happens in the database. This can be achieved using two powerful tools: functions and triggers.

A **[function](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/xfunc-sql.html)** is a program code that is implemented inside the database using SQL or a set of other languages (e.g. SQL, PSQL, Python, C). Functions allow you to create complex processes and algorithms when SQL queries alone cannot do the job. Once created, a function becomes part of the database library and can be called inside SQL queries. In the framework of these lessons, you do not need to create your own functions, but you must be aware of the possibility offered by these tools and be able to understand and use existing functions that advanced users can adapt according to their specific needs.

A **[trigger](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/triggers.html)** is a specification that the database should automatically execute a particular function whenever a certain type of operation is performed on a particular table in the database. The trigger fires a specific function to perform some actions BEFORE or AFTER records are DELETED, UPDATED, or INSERTED in a table. The trigger function must be defined before the trigger itself can be created. The trigger function must be declared as a function taking no arguments and returning type trigger. For example, when you insert a new record in a table, you can modify the values of the attributes before they are uploaded or you can update another table that should be affected by this new upload. It is important to stress that triggers are very powerful tools for automating the data flow. The drawback is that they will slow down the data import process. This note is also valid for indexes, which speed up queries but imply some additional computation during the import stage. In the case of frequent uploads (or modification) of very large data sets at once, the use of the proposed triggers could significantly decrease performance. In these cases, you can more quickly process the data in a later stage after they are imported into the database and therefore available to users. The best approach must be identified according to the specific goals, constraints, and characteristics of your application. In this guide, we use as reference the management of data coming from a set of sensors deployed on animals, transmitting data in near real time, where the import step will include just few thousand locations at a time. 

It might be convenient to store all functions and ancillary tools in a defined schema:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA tools
  AUTHORIZATION postgres;
  GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA tools TO basic_user;
```

```sql
COMMENT ON SCHEMA tools 
IS 'Schema that hosts all the functions and ancillary tools used for the database.';
```

```sql
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES 
  IN SCHEMA tools 
  GRANT SELECT ON TABLES 
  TO basic_user;
```

Here a simple example of an SQL function that makes the sum of two input integers:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION tools.test_add(integer, integer) 
  RETURNS integer AS 
'SELECT $1 + $2;'
LANGUAGE SQL
IMMUTABLE
RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT;
```

The variables *$1* and *$2* are the first and second input parameters. You can test it with

```sql
SELECT tools.test_add(2,7);
```

As a first simple example of a trigger, you add a field to the table *gps\_data\_animals* where you register the timestamp of the last modification (update) of each record in order to keep track of the changes in the table. This field can have *now()*as default when data is inserted the first time:

```sql
ALTER TABLE main.gps_data_animals 
  ADD COLUMN update_timestamp timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now();
```

Once you have created the field, you need a function called by a trigger to set this field to the timestamp of the change time whenever a record is updated. The SQL to generate the function is:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tools.timestamp_last_update()
RETURNS trigger AS
$BODY$BEGIN
IF NEW IS DISTINCT FROM OLD THEN
  NEW.update_timestamp = now();
END IF;
RETURN NEW;
END;$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE
COST 100;
```

```sql
COMMENT ON FUNCTION tools.timestamp_last_update() 
IS 'When a record is updated, the update_timestamp is set to the current time.';
```

Here is the code for the trigger that calls the function:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_timestamp
  BEFORE UPDATE
  ON main.gps_data_animals
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE tools.timestamp_last_update();
```

You have to initialize the existing records in the table, as the trigger/function was not yet created when data were uploaded:

```sql
UPDATE main.gps_data_animals 
  SET update_timestamp = now();
```

Another interesting application of triggers is the automation of the *acquisition\_time* computation when a new record is inserted into the *gps\_data* table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tools.acquisition_time_update()
RETURNS trigger AS
$BODY$BEGIN
  NEW.acquisition_time = ((NEW.utc_date + NEW.utc_time) at time zone 'UTC');
  RETURN NEW;
END;$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE
COST 100;
```

```sql
COMMENT ON FUNCTION tools.acquisition_time_update() 
IS 'When a record is inserted, the acquisition_time is composed from utc_date and utc_time.';
```

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER update_acquisition_time
  BEFORE INSERT
  ON main.gps_data
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE tools.acquisition_time_update();
```

### <a name="c_2.14.2"></a>Automation of the GPS data association with animals
In the case of a large number of sensors and animals, the association of locations to animals is hard to manage manually, and usually requires some dedicated, and possibly automated, tools. Moreover, the process of associating GPS positions and animals must be able to manage dynamic changes in the information about sensor deployment. For example, hours or even days can pass before the death of an animal tagged with a GPS sensor is discovered. In the while, the GPS positions acquired in near real time are associated with the animal. This is an error, as the positions recorded between the death and its detection by researchers are not valid and must be 'disassociated' from the animal. A tool to automatically and dynamically update the association between animals and GPS location based on the information stored in the table on sensors deployment would also efficiently manages the re-deployment of a GPS sensor recovered from an animal (because of e.g. end of battery or death of the animal) to another animal, and the deployment of a new GPS sensor on an animal previously monitored with another GPS sensor.

With triggers and functions, you can automatize the upload from *gps\_data* to *gps\_data\_animals* of records that are associated with animals (a sensor deployed on an animal). First, you have to create the function that will be called by the trigger:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tools.gps_data2gps_data_animals()
RETURNS trigger AS
$BODY$ begin
INSERT INTO main.gps_data_animals (
  animals_id, gps_sensors_id, acquisition_time, longitude, latitude)
SELECT 
  gps_sensors_animals.animals_id, gps_sensors_animals.gps_sensors_id, NEW.acquisition_time, NEW.longitude, NEW.latitude
FROM 
  main.gps_sensors_animals, main.gps_sensors
WHERE 
  NEW.gps_sensors_code = gps_sensors.gps_sensors_code AND 
  gps_sensors.gps_sensors_id = gps_sensors_animals.gps_sensors_id AND
  (
    (NEW.acquisition_time >= gps_sensors_animals.start_time AND 
     NEW.acquisition_time <= gps_sensors_animals.end_time)
    OR 
    (NEW.acquisition_time >= gps_sensors_animals.start_time AND 
     gps_sensors_animals.end_time IS NULL)
  );
RETURN NULL;
END
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE
COST 100;
```

```sql
COMMENT ON FUNCTION tools.gps_data2gps_data_animals() 
IS 'Automatic upload data from gps_data to gps_data_animals.';
```

Then, you create a trigger that calls the function whenever a new record is uploaded into \*gps\_data\*:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_gps_data_upload
  AFTER INSERT
  ON main.gps_data
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE tools.gps_data2gps_data_animals();
```

```sql
COMMENT ON TRIGGER trigger_gps_data_upload ON main.gps_data
IS 'Upload data from gps_data to gps_data_animals whenever a new record is inserted.';
```

You can test this function by adding the last GPS sensor not yet imported:

```sql
COPY main.gps_data(
  gps_sensors_code, line_no, utc_date, utc_time, lmt_date, lmt_time, ecef_x, ecef_y, ecef_z, latitude, longitude, height, dop, nav, validated, sats_used, ch01_sat_id, ch01_sat_cnr, ch02_sat_id, ch02_sat_cnr, ch03_sat_id, ch03_sat_cnr, ch04_sat_id, ch04_sat_cnr, ch05_sat_id, ch05_sat_cnr, ch06_sat_id, ch06_sat_cnr, ch07_sat_id, ch07_sat_cnr, ch08_sat_id, ch08_sat_cnr, ch09_sat_id, ch09_sat_cnr, ch10_sat_id, ch10_sat_cnr, ch11_sat_id, ch11_sat_cnr, ch12_sat_id, ch12_sat_cnr, main_vol, bu_vol, temp, easting, northing, remarks)
FROM 
  'C:\tracking_db\data\sensors_data\GSM02927.csv' 
  WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER, DELIMITER ';');
```

Data are automatically processed and imported into the table *gps\_data\_animals* including the correct association with the animal wearing the sensor.


### <a name="c_2.14.3"></a>Consistency checks on the deployments information

The management of the association between animals and GPS sensors can be further improved using additional, more sophisticated tools. A first example is the implementation of consistency checks on the *gps\_sensors\_animals* table. You already created a check to ensure that the *start\_date* &lt; *end\_date*, but this is not enough to prevent illogical associations between animals and sensors. The two most evident constraints are that the same sensor cannot be worn by two animals at the same time, and that no more than one GPS sensor can be deployed on the same animal at the same time (this assumption can be questionable in case of other sensors, but in general can be considered valid for GPS). To avoid any impossible overlaps in animal/sensor deployments, you have to create a trigger on both insertion and updates of records in *gps\_animals\_sensors* that verifies the correctness of the new values (i.e. the new deployment interval is not in conflict with other existing deployments). **[NEW](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/plpgsql-trigger.html)** in a BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE trigger refers to the values that are going to be inserted. In an UPDATE/DELETE trigger, **[OLD](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/plpgsql-trigger.html)** refers to the value that is going to be modified. In case of invalid values, the insert/modify statement is aborted and an error message is raised by the database. Here is an example of code for this function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tools.gps_sensors_animals_consistency_check()
RETURNS trigger AS
$BODY$
DECLARE
  deletex integer;
BEGIN

SELECT 
  gps_sensors_animals_id 
INTO 
  deletex 
FROM 
  main.gps_sensors_animals b
WHERE
  (NEW.animals_id = b.animals_id OR NEW.gps_sensors_id = b.gps_sensors_id)
  AND
  (
  (NEW.start_time > b.start_time AND NEW.start_time < b.end_time)
  OR
  (NEW.start_time > b.start_time AND b.end_time IS NULL)
  OR
  (NEW.end_time > b.start_time AND NEW.end_time < b.end_time)
  OR
  (NEW.start_time < b.start_time AND NEW.end_time > b.end_time)
  OR
  (NEW.start_time < b.start_time AND NEW.end_time IS NULL )
  OR
  (NEW.end_time > b.start_time AND b.end_time IS NULL)
);

IF deletex IS not NULL THEN
  IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'This row is not inserted: Animal-sensor association not valid: (the same animal would wear two different GPS sensors at the same time or the same GPS sensor would be deployed on two animals at the same time).';
    RETURN NULL;
  END IF;
  IF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
    IF deletex != OLD.gps_sensors_animals_id THEN
      RAISE EXCEPTION 'This row is not updated: Animal-sensor association not valid (the same animal would wear two different GPS sensors at the same time or the same GPS sensor would be deployed on two animals at the same time).';
      RETURN NULL;
    END IF;
  END IF;
END IF;

RETURN NEW;
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE
COST 100;
```

```sql
COMMENT ON FUNCTION tools.gps_sensors_animals_consistency_check() 
IS 'Check if a modified or insert row in gps_sensors_animals is valid (no impossible time range overlaps of deployments).';
```

Here is an example of the trigger to call the function:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER gps_sensors_animals_changes_consistency
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE
  ON main. gps_sensors_animals
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE tools.gps_sensors_animals_consistency_check();
```

You can test this process by trying to insert a deployment of a GPS sensor in the `gps_sensors_animals` table in a time interval that overlaps the association of the same sensor on another animal:

```sql
INSERT INTO main.gps_sensors_animals
  (animals_id, gps_sensors_id, start_time, end_time, notes)
VALUES
  (2,2,'2004-10-23 20:00:53 +0','2005-11-28 13:00:00 +0','Ovelapping sensor');
```

You should receive an error message like:

```
> **\*\*\**** Error ***\*\**\**** ERROR: This row is not inserted:
Animal-sensor association not valid: (the same animal would wear two
different GPS sensors at the same time or the same GPS sensor would be
deployed on two animals at the same time). SQL state: P0001
```

### <a name="c_2.14.4"></a>Synchronization of *gps\_sensors\_animals* and *gps\_data\_animals*

In an operational environment where data are managed in (near) real time, it happens that the information about the association between animals and sensors changes over time. A typical example is the death of an animal: this event is usually discovered with a delay of some days. In the meantime, GPS positions are received and associated with the animals in the *gps\_data\_animals* table. When the new information on the deployment time range is registered in*gps\_sensors\_animals*, the table *gps\_data\_animals* must be changed accordingly. It is highly desirable that any change in the table *gps\_sensors\_animals* is automatically reflected in *gps\_data\_animals*. It is possible to use triggers to keep the two tables automatically synchronized in real time. Here below you have an example of a trigger function to implement this procedure. The code is fairly complex because it manages the three possible operations: delete, insert, and modification of the *gps\_sensors\_animals* table. For each case, it checks whether GPS positions previously associated with an animal are no longer valid (and if so, deletes them from the table *gps\_data\_animals*) and whether GPS positions previously not associated with the animal should now be linked (and if so, adds them to the table*gps\_data\_animals*).

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tools.gps_sensors_animals2gps_data_animals()
RETURNS trigger AS
$BODY$ begin

IF TG_OP = 'DELETE' THEN

  DELETE FROM 
    main.gps_data_animals 
  WHERE 
    animals_id = OLD.animals_id AND
    gps_sensors_id = OLD.gps_sensors_id AND
    acquisition_time >= OLD.start_time AND
    (acquisition_time <= OLD.end_time OR OLD.end_time IS NULL);
  RETURN NULL;

END IF;

IF TG_OP = 'INSERT' THEN

  INSERT INTO 
    main.gps_data_animals (gps_sensors_id, animals_id, acquisition_time, longitude, latitude)
  SELECT 
    NEW.gps_sensors_id, NEW.animals_id, gps_data.acquisition_time, gps_data.longitude, gps_data.latitude

    gps_data.gps_sensors_code = gps_sensors.gps_sensors_code AND
    gps_data.acquisition_time >= NEW.start_time AND
    (gps_data.acquisition_time <= NEW.end_time OR NEW.end_time IS NULL);
  RETURN NULL;

          animals_id = OLD.animals_id AND

        ) d
      LEFT OUTER JOIN

```sql
COMMENT ON FUNCTION tools.gps_sensors_animals2gps_data_animals() 
IS 'When a record in gps_sensors_animals is deleted OR updated OR inserted, this function synchronizes this information with gps_data_animals.';
```

Here is the code of the trigger to call the function:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER synchronize_gps_data_animals
  AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE

  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE tools.gps_sensors_animals2gps_data_animals();
```


### <a name="c_2.14.5"></a>Automating the creation of points from GPS coordinates

Working with massive data sets (i.e. many sensors at the same time) in near real time requires that routinely operations are done automatically to save time and to avoid errors of manual processing. Here you create a new function to update the geometry field as soon as a new record is uploaded. 

You can automate the population of the geometry column so that whenever a new GPS position is updated in the table *main.gps\_data\_animals*, the spatial geometry is also created. To do so, you need a trigger and its related function. Here is the SQL code to generate the function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tools.new_gps_data_animals()
RETURNS trigger AS
$BODY$
DECLARE 
thegeom geometry;
BEGIN

IF NEW.longitude IS NOT NULL AND NEW.latitude IS NOT NULL THEN
  thegeom = ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(NEW.longitude, NEW.latitude),4326);
  NEW.geom = thegeom;
END IF;

RETURN NEW;
END;$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE
COST 100;
```

```sql
COMMENT ON FUNCTION tools.new_gps_data_animals() 
IS 'When called by a trigger (insert_gps_locations) this function populates the field geom using the values from longitude and latitude fields.';
```

And here is the SQL code to generate the trigger:

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER insert_gps_location
  BEFORE INSERT
  ON main.gps_data_animals
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE tools.new_gps_data_animals();
```

You can see the result by deleting all the records from the *main.gps\_data\_animals* table, e.g. for animal 2, and reloading them. As you have set an automatic procedure to synchronize *main.gps\_data\_animals* table with the information contained in the table *main.gps\_sensors\_animals*, you can drop the animal 2 record from *main.gps\_sensors\_animals* and this will affect *main.gps\_data\_animals* in a cascade effect (note that it will not affect the original data in *main.gps\_data*):

```sql
DELETE FROM 
  main.gps_sensors_animals 
WHERE 
  animals_id = 2;
```

There are now no rows for animal 2 in the table *main.gps\_data\_animals*. You can verify this by retrieving the number of locations per animal:

```sql
SELECT 
  animals_id, count(animals_id) 
FROM 
  main.gps_data_animals
GROUP BY 
  animals_id
ORDER BY 
  animals_id;
```

Note that animal 2 is not in the list. Now you reload the record in the *main.gps\_sensors\_animals*:

```sql
INSERT INTO main.gps_sensors_animals 
  (animals_id, gps_sensors_id, start_time, end_time, notes) 
VALUES 
  (2,1,'2005-03-20 16:03:14 +0','2006-05-27 17:00:00 +0','End of battery life. Sensor not recovered.');
```

You can see that records have been re-added to *main.gps\_data\_animals* by reloading the original data stored in *main.gps\_data*, with the geometry field correctly and automatically populated (when longitude and latitude are not null):

```sql
SELECT 
  animals_id, count(animals_id) AS num_records, count(geom) AS num_records_valid 
FROM 
  main.gps_data_animals
GROUP BY 
  animals_id
ORDER BY 
  animals_id;
```

You can now play around with your spatial data set. For example, when you have a number of locations per animal, you can find the centroid of the area covered by the locations:

```sql
SELECT 
  animals_id, 
  ST_AsEWKT(
    ST_Centroid(
     ST_Collect(geom))) AS centroid 
FROM 
  main.gps_data_animals 
WHERE 
  geom IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY 
  animals_id 
ORDER BY 
  animals_id;
```

In this case you used the SQL command **[ST\_Collect](http://postgis.refractions.net/docs/ST_Collect.html)**. This function returns a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION or a MULTI object from a set of geometries. The collect function is an 'aggregate' function in the terminology of PostgreSQL. That means that it operates on rows of data, in the same way the sum() and mean() functions do. *ST\_Collect* and **[ST\_Union](http://postgis.refractions.net/docs/ST_Union.html)** are often interchangeable. *ST\_Collect* is in general orders of magnitude faster than *ST\_Union* because it does not try to dissolve boundaries. It merely rolls up single geometries into MULTI and MULTI or mixed geometry types into Geometry Collections. The contrary of *ST\_Collect* is **[ST\_Dump](http://postgis.refractions.net/docs/ST_Dump.html)**, which is a set-returning function.

### <a name="c_2.14.6"></a>UTM zone of a given point in geographic coordinates

Here you create a simple function to automatically find the UTM zone at defined coordinates:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tools.srid_utm(longitude double precision, latitude double precision)
RETURNS integer AS
$BODY$
DECLARE
  srid integer;
  lon float;
  lat float;
BEGIN
  lat := latitude;
  lon := longitude;

IF ((lon > 360 or lon < -360) or (lat > 90 or lat < -90)) THEN 
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'Longitude and latitude is not in a valid format (-360 to 360; -90 to 90)';
ELSEIF (longitude < -180)THEN 
  lon := 360 + lon;
ELSEIF (longitude > 180)THEN 
  lon := 180 - lon;
END IF;

IF latitude >= 0 THEN 
  srid := 32600 + floor((lon+186)/6); 
ELSE
  srid := 32700 + floor((lon+186)/6); 
END IF;

RETURN srid;
END;
$BODY$
LANGUAGE plpgsql VOLATILE STRICT
COST 100;
```

```sql
COMMENT ON FUNCTION tools.srid_utm(double precision, double precision) 
IS 'Function that returns the SRID code of the UTM zone where a point (in geographic coordinates) is located. For polygons or line, it can be used giving ST_x(ST_Centroid(the_geom)) and ST_y(ST_Centroid(the_geom)) as parameters. This function is typically used be used with ST_Transform to project elements with no prior knowledge of their position.';
```

Here an example to see the SRID of the UTM zone of the point at
coordinates (11.001,46.001):

```sql
SELECT TOOLS.SRID_UTM(11.001,46.001) AS UTM_zone;
```

The result 32632 corresponds to UTM 32 N WGS84.

You can use this function to project points when you do not know the UTM zone. You can test this functionality with the following code:

```sql
SELECT
  ST_AsEWKT(
    ST_Transform(
      ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(31.001,16.001), 4326),
      TOOLS.SRID_UTM(31.001,16.001))
  ) AS projected_point;
```

If you want to allow the user `basic_user` to project spatial data, you have to grant permission on the table `spatial_ref_sys`:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE spatial_ref_sys TO basic_user;
```
