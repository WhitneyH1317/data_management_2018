## 3.1 Introduction to R

R is a statistical environment based on a command-line language. R is
a free and open-source software. You can thus *freely* use it,
*freely* distribute it, and *freely* modify and redistribute it. R is
available on the [R-project website](https://www.r-project.org).

* R comes with an entire ecosystem of packages, which provide
  additional features to the software. Prominent packages are hosted
  on CRAN, which has now more than 12,000 packages. Some packages
  provide generic functionalities that are useful in most cases
  (modeling, graphs, etc.), other are heavily specialized on specific
  tasks (e.g. parallel processing, connection to a database, habitat
  selection, finances, etc.). The ecosystem is now so rich that if a
  statistical tool or feature has been developed, the chances that it
  exists as a R package are fairly high. You can check [CRAN task
  views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) to find out what
  packages are available on specific subjects.

* R can handle pretty much any type of input, from plain text files
  (`.txt` or `.csv` files for instance), Excel spreadsheets, database
  tables, or even data copied in the clipboard. R can also scrape
  information from the web, either by direct download of files, or by
  parsing web pages.

* R allows modeling at an advanced level. Pretty much all statistical
  models are available directly in base R or in external packages,
  such as Generalized linear models (GLM), mixed models (with random
  factors), Generalized additive models (GAM), Random forest, machine
  learning, etc.

* R has truly amazing capabilities when it comes to graphics, with
  incredible flexibility, and amazing results. Interested users may
  want to have a look at the `ggplot2` package (see next point).

* The [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org/) is a cohesive set of
  packages on its own. It notably provides a graphic system that
  greatly improve base R capabilities by implementing a grammar of
  graphics (package `ggplot2`), and also provides a very clean
  approach of dealing with tabular data that relies on database
  principles (package `dplyr`). Although familiarity with these
  packages brings many benefits, this tutorial does not cover the
  `tidyverse`.

* As a statistical engine, R unleashes advanced uses of its
  capabilities through external applications or media. Most notably, R
  allows for reproducible science through the use of
  [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files that automatically
  generate reports, as well as the development of web applications
  that allows dynamic interface to data and statistical models through
  the [Shiny package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny).

An introductory tutorial can be found
[here](https://ase-research.org/R/intro/), and present basic
capabilities of R, and how to get started with different data types
and graphics.
